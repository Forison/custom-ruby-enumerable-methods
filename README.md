# Custom Ruby Enumerable Methods (just a few)

This is a solo project as a way to enforce my understanding of creating and using ruby methods, module and the enumerator. In this project, I implemented some commonly used enumerable methods as part of the ruby built-in Enumerable module Array and Enumerator classes. Check below to full list of the methods implemented in this project.

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").

## Technologies

- Ruby

## Scope

The methods implemented in this project include:

- #my_each
- #my_each_with_index
- #my_select
- #my_all?
- #my_any?
- #my_none?
- #my_count
- #my_map
- #my_inject
  > Note: #my_inject is a partial implementation as it does not take into account certain complexities

## Usage

> Clone the repository to your local machine

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ebukaume/custom-ruby-enumerable-methods.git
```

> cd into the directory

```sh
$ cd custom-ruby-enumerable-methods
```

> load the module. Note: make sure to prepend the current path

```ruby
require "./custom-methods.rb>"
```

> Then use the methods like you would use built-in ruby enumerable methods
